## How to think about data


## Things to keep in mind


### Noise and error in biomedical data

Errors and noise are two common sources of variability that can impact the accuracy and reliability of biomedical data. 
Understanding the differences between these two types of variability is crucial for ensuring that research findings and 
clinical decisions are based on high-quality data.

*Error* refers to the difference between the true value or state of a measurement or observation and the recorded or 
measured value or state. These can arise from a variety of sources, including measurement error, sampling error, 
data entry error, and observer bias. Errors are typically systematic and non-random, and can be minimized through 
careful experimental design and data collection protocols.

*Noise*, on the other hand, refers to random or stochastic fluctuations in the data that are not related to the 
underlying biological signal or phenomenon of interest. This can arise from a variety of sources, 
including biological variability, measurement noise, and motion artifacts. 
Noise is typically random and non-systematic, and can be minimized through signal processing techniques such as 
filtering or averaging.

Both errors and noise can impact the validity and reliability of biomedical data, and it is important to carefully 
consider both sources of variability when analyzing and interpreting data. 
By understanding the differences between these two types of variability and implementing appropriate strategies for minimizing 
their effects, researchers and data analysis can ensure that their findings and decisions are based on data that are as high-quality, 
accurate, and reliable as possible.
