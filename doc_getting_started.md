In this section, you will find everything you need to get started with advanced Python programming. 
Make sure you are up-to-speed with all these tools and their functioning before starting your adventure with the course!

After a [Python refresher](doc_getting_started_00_refresher.md),
you will find info on how to write code efficiently ([IDEs and Interactive Notebooks](doc_getting_started_01_writing_and_running_code.md)), how to avoid common problems with package dependencies ([Virtual Environments](doc_getting_started_02_virtual_environments.md)), and
how to track changes to your code and write large projects ([version control](doc_getting_started_03_version_control.md)). 
Use the Table of Contents below to navigate this section.
