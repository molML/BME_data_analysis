# The pragmatic programmer
{: .no_toc }

> *Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you
want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part
advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find
a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to
document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so
that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the relentless ticking
of the project clock.\ 
> You work small miracles every day.\
> It's a difficult job.*
> 
> A. Hunt, D. Thomas - The Pragmatic Programmer.
> 
Blablablabla something on the fact that there are no rules that are set in stone, but it is good to know what the heck we are doing.
Below you will find several accepted guidelines.
