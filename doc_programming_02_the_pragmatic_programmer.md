# The pragmatic programmer
{: .no_toc }

> *Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you
want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part
advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find
a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to
document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so
that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the relentless ticking
of the project clock.*

> *You work small miracles every day.*

## A Pragmatic philosophy

The expression "Pragmatic Programmer" comes from a [book](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) 
of Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt, who write:
> *"it's an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem,
always trying to place it in its larger context, always trying to be aware of the bigger picture.
After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic? How can you make
intelligent compromises and informed decisions?"*

In what follows, we have identified a few characteristics that will allow you to write better code, in a pragmatical way. These are all inspired
by [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/), where you will
find more in-depth insights.
