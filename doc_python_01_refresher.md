## Why Python?

As stated in the [official page of python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/):\
"Python is one of the worldâ€™s most used and most popular programming languages. Itâ€™s powerful, versatile, and easy to 
learn. Python is widely used in various applications, some notable ones:
- Web development
- Data Science
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Scripting and tooling"

For this course, we expect you to have basic knowledge of the Python programming language. If you need a refresher, 
we have you covered! Just keep reading. 

## Getting started
### Installing Python and quickstarting
There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),<sup>*</sup> 
which will install Python alongside some useful packages. Make sure to use Python 3 (e.g., v.3.7 or superior). 

To check if Python was successfully  installed, you can use the following commands:\
On a Windows computer (command line):\
```C:\Users\Your Name>python --version```

On a Mac or Linux computer (terminal):\
```$ python --version```

Congrats! Now you have installed Python! You can find examples and exercises on how to get started with Python on the
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) website, in the 
[Python Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) page.

<sup>*</sup><u>Spoiler Alert!</u> Miniconda will be useful to install additional packages you might need, see the [Tools](doc_python_02_tools.md) page.

### Nice-to-haves

Other few ingredients will make your life easier and more fun while coding. They are:
1. A Python IDE, to write better code, faster. Have a look at the [tools](doc_python_02_tools.md) page, in the IDE section.
2. A package manager , such as Conda. See [tools](doc_python_02_tools.md) page.
3. A computer! ðŸ’»

## Python syntax

### Basic syntax

  </summary>

The examples below are taken from the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming), 
where you will find even more!

**Numbers and operations**
The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it, and it will write the value. 
Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` are used to perform calculation, 
and the parentheses (`()`) are for grouping. For example:

```python
>> 2 + 2
4
>> 50 - 5*6
20
>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
```
Division (`/`) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the `//` operator; 
to calculate the remainder you can use `%`:

```python
>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5
>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2
>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
17
```

With Python, the `**` operator can be used to calculate powers:
```python
>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25
>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
128
```

The equal sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.
```python
>> width = 20
>> height = 5 * 9
>> width * height
900
```

<u>Warning!</u> The operator `=` should not be confused with `==`, which is used to compare objects based on their values:
```python
>> width = 20  # assigns the value the variable
>> width == 25 # compares it with 25
False
```

**Strings**

Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed either with single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes
with the same result. `\` can be used to escape quotes:
```python
>> 'mountain trail'  # single quotes
'mountain trail'
>> 'doesn\'t'        # use \' to escape the single quote
"doesn't"
>> "doesn't"         # or use double quotes instead
"doesn't"
>> '"No," they said.'
'"No," they said.'
>> "\"No,\" they said."
'"No," they said.'
>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
```
Strings can be concatenated  with the `+` operator, and repeated with `*`:
```python
>> 'sci' + 'ence'         # concatenation
'science'
>> 2*'da'                 # repetition
'dada'
>> 2 * 'per' + 'petual'   # repetition and concatenation
'perpetual'
```
**Lists**

Lists are a versatile way to group values together. 
With lists, comma-separated values (items) are specified between square brackets. 
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
```python
>> values = [1, 2, 5]
values
[1, 2, 5]
```
Lists can be indexed and sliced:
```python
>> values = [1, 2, 5]
>> squares[0]          # indexing returns the item
1
>> values[-2:]         # slicing returns a new list
[2,5]
```
If you are confused about the values returned in the previous example, you're not alone. Keep reading until the indexing
section below.

Lists also support operations like concatenation:
```python
>> values + [27, 28]
[1, 2, 5, 27, 28]
```

You can also change the content of a list:
```python
>> values
[1, 2, 5]
>> values[0] = 40
>> values
[40, 2, 5]
```
You can add new items at the end of the list, by using `append()`, and count the items it contains with `len()`: 
```python
>> values              # displays the list
[40, 2, 5]
>> len(values)         # counts the number of items
3
>> values.append(100)  # appends a new item
>> values              # displays the list again
[40, 2, 5, 100]
>> len(values)         # counts the number of items again
4
```

**Python indexing and slicing**
If you come from other programming languages such as [MATLAB](), [Julia](), or [R],(), you might be surprised to discover
that Python starts counting from 0. 
```python
>> a = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'monkey']
>> a[0]             # first element of the list
'cat'
>> a[1]             # second element of the list
'dog'
>> a[len(a)-1]      # ultimate element (lenght - 1) of the list
'monkey'
>> a[:]             # entire list
['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'monkey']
```
You can also use negative numbers for indexing, which starts to count from the end of the sequence:

```python
>>> a[-1]
'monkey'
>>> a[-2]
'mouse'
>>> a[-4]
'cat'
```

### Indentation
<details close markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Expand
  </summary>

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Whereas other programming languages use indentation 
for readability, in Python, indentation is a key element of the syntax. In fact, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

```python
# Correct usage of indentation
a = 10
if 10 > 3:
  print("a is greater than three!")
  if a > 9:
      print("a is also greater than 9")

      
# This would give a syntax error  
if 10 > 3:
print("Ten is greater than three!")
if a > 9:
print("a is also greater than 9")
```

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one! Also, check out [Writing good Python code > Python PEP8 Style Guide](#doc_python_style)
on suggestions regarding the 'stylistic' usage of spaces.

### Variables, types, and casting
<details close markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Expand
  </summary>

**Variable types**

Python supports different types of variables:
* whole integers (e.g., 3)
* floating point numbers (e.g., 3.1415926)
* booleans (true or false)
* strings (text) (e.g., "Python")

You do not need to specify the datatype of a variable, you can simply assign any value to a variable. 
Try with the exercise below:

```python
x = 3              # an integer                   
f = 3.1415926      # a floating point number              
name = "Python"    # a string

print(x)
print(f)
print(name)

combination = name + " " + name
print(combination)

sum = f + f
print(sum)
```

**Variable casting**

There may be cases in which you want to specify a type on to a variable. 
Casting in Python is rather easy, and can be done with the following functions:
* `int()` constructs an integer number from an integer, a float (by removing all decimals), or a string (providing the string represents a whole number).
* `float()` constructs a float number from an integer, a float or a string (providing the string represents a float or an integer).
* `str()` - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals.

See the example below (taken from [W3schools](hhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp)):
```python
# Integers
x = int(1)       # x will be 1
y = int(2.8)     # y will be 2
z = int("3")     # z will be 3

# Float numbers
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

# Strings
x = str("s1")    # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)       # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)     # z will be '3.0'
```


**Naming variables**

A variable name <u>must</u> begin with a letter (upper or lower case) or an underscore. Variables cannot start with a number 
and are case-sensitive. Several conventions for names exist, such as capitalized words (also known as camel-casing), lower-letters,
capitalization. 

```python
MyBelovedVariable = 3    # camel case                   
mybelovedvariable = 4    # lower letter
MYBELOVEDVARIABLE = 5    # capitalized
```

On Style

**Python operators**

Python has 35 reserved words that cannot be used as variable names. Here are some of the ones that will be useful for you. 
A full list can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics).

## Fundamentals of Python programming

### Logical conditions

<details close markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Click here to expand
  </summary>

**Mathematical conditions**
Python supports simple logical conditions, such as:
* Equals: `a == b`
* Does not Equal: `a != b`
* Less than: `a < b`
* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
* Greater than: `a > b`
* Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

**If statements** 

The `if` statements are used to specify specific behaviours when one (or more) condition(s) are satisfied.

You can specify a single condition, for instance:
```python
a = 40
b = 100
if b > a:
  print("b is larger than a")
```

If you want to specify more than one condition, you can combine `if` and `else`:
```python
a = 40
b = 100
if b > a:
  print("b is larger than a")
else:
  print("b is not larger than a")
```

To specify more than two conditions, you can use `elif` (else-if), too:
```python
a = 40
b = 100
if b > a:
  print("b is larger than a")
elif b < a:
  print("b is smaller than a")
else:
  print("b is equal to a")
```

</details>

### Loops
<details close markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Click here to expand
  </summary>

A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. In Python,
this can be achieved using `for` or `while` statements.

**'For' loops** 

A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```python
# Print each fruit in a fruit list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

# Loop through the letters in the word "banana":
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```

Loops can be exited using the `break` statement:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
```
**'While' loops** 

The `while` executes a set of statements as long as the specified condition is true.

```python
# prints the value of i starting from 1 and terminating at 9
i = 1
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  i += 1 
```

Also in this case, you can use the `break` statement:
```python
# prints the value of i starting from 1 and terminates the loop when i is 4
i = 1
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  if i == 4:
    break
  i += 1
```
</details>

### Functions
<details close markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Click here to expand
  </summary>
A function is a block of code that runs only when it is called. You can pass data (known as parameters), into a function.
In python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword, as follows:

```python
def hello():
  print("Hello world!")
```
This function will be called as `hello()`, and will print the specified string. 
```
>>> hello()
Hello world!
```
**Function arguments**

Information can be passed into functions as arguments, for instance:
```python
def hello(name):
  print("Hello " + name + "!")
```
Which would result in the following:
```
>>> hello("Michael")
Hello Michael!

>>> hello("Meilina")
Hello Meilina!
```
More than one parameter can be allowed, for instance:
```python
def hello(first_name, last_name):
  print("Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name + "!")
```
results in the following:
```
>>hello("LeBron","James")
Hello LeBron James!
```

**Arbitrary arguments** (`*args`)

If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in 
the function definition. In this way the arguments will be passed as a *tuple*, and you can access the items accordingly:
```python
def smallest(*ages):
  print(str(min(ages))) # computes the minimum and converts to a string for printing
```
results in the following:
```
>>smallest(1,2,3)
1
>>smallest(-100,1,2,3,100)
-100
```

**Arbitrary arguments** (`**kwargs`)

`**kwargs` (key word arguments) works like `*args`, but instead of accepting positional arguments it accepts keyword (or named) arguments.

```python
def person_details(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs, type(kwargs))
```
results in the following:
```
>>person_details(name="LeBron", surname="James", height=2.06)
{'surname': 'James', 'name': 'LeBron', 'height': 2.06}

>>person_details(name="Peppa", surname="Pig", DoB="May 30")
{'DoB': 'May 30', 'surname': 'Pig', 'name': 'Peppa'}
```
</details>
