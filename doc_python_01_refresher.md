## Getting started
### Installing Python and quickstarting
There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),<sup>*</sup> 
which will install Python alongside some useful packages. Make sure to use Python 3 (e.g., v.3.7 or superior). 

To check if Python was successfully  installed, you can use the following commands:\
On a Windows computer (command line):\
```C:\Users\Your Name>python --version```

On a Mac or Linux computer (terminal):\
```python --version```

Congrats! Now you have installed Python! You can find examples and exercises on how to get started with Python on the
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) website, in the 
[Python Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) page.

<sup>*</sup><u>Spoiler Alert!</u> Miniconda will be useful to install additional packages you might need, see the [Tools](doc_python_02_tools) page.

### Nice-to-haves

Other few ingredients will make your life easier and more fun while coding. They are:
1. A Python IDE, to write better code, faster. Have a look at the [IDE Section](doc_python_02_tools).
2. A package manager, such as Conda (see #TODO).
3. A computer!
