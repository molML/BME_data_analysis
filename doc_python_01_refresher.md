# Python Refresher
{: .no_toc }

For the scopes of this course, we assume you have basic knowledge of the python programming language. If you don't have basics of Python, 
have a look at the [additional resources](#additional-resources) section. If you just need a 
refresher, no problem, we have you covered! Just keep reading...

## Getting started
### Installing Python and quickstarting
There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),<sup>*</sup> 
which will install Python alongside some useful packages. Make sure to use Python 3 (e.g., v.3.7 or superior). 

To check if Python was successfully  installed, you can use the following commands:\
On a Windows computer (command line):\
```C:\Users\Your Name>python --version```

On a Mac or Linux computer (terminal):\
```python --version```

Congrats! Now you have installed Python! You can find examples and exercises on how to get started with Python on the
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) website, in the 
[Python Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) page.

<sup>*</sup><u>Spoiler Alert!</u> Miniconda will be useful to install additional packages you might need, see the [Tools](doc_python_02_tools) page.

### Nice-to-haves

Other few ingredients will make your life easier and more fun while coding. They are:
1. A Python IDE, to write better code, faster. Have a look at the [IDE Section](doc_python_02_tools).
2. A package manager, such as Conda (see #TODO).
3. A computer!

## Python syntax

### Basic syntax

### Indentation

### Variables, types, and casting
\
**Variable types**

Python supports different types of variables:
* whole integers (e.g., 3)
* floating point numbers (e.g., 3.1415926)
* booleans (true or false)
* strings (text) (e.g., "Python")

You do not need to specify the datatype of a variable, you can simply assign any value to a variable. 
Try with the exercise below:

```python
x = 3              # an integer                   
f = 3.1415926      # a floating point number              
name = "Python"    # a string

print(x)
print(f)
print(name)

combination = name + " " + name
print(combination)

sum = f + f
print(sum)
```

**Variable casting**

There may be cases in which you want to specify a type on to a variable. 
Casting in python is rather easy, and can be done with the following functions:
* `int()` constructs an integer number from an integer, a float (by removing all decimals), or a string (providing the string represents a whole number).
* `float()` constructs a float number from an integer, a float or a string (providing the string represents a float or an integer).
* `str()` - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals.

See the example below (taken from [W3schools](hhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp)):
```python
# Integers
x = int(1)       # x will be 1
y = int(2.8)     # y will be 2
z = int("3")     # z will be 3

# Float numbers
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

# Strings
x = str("s1")    # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)       # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)     # z will be '3.0'
```


**Naming variables**

A variable name <u>must</u> begin with a letter (upper or lower case) or an underscore. Variables cannot start with a number 
and are case-sensitive. Several conventions for names exist, such as capitalized words (also known as camel-casing), lower-letters,
capitalization. 

```python
MyBelovedVariable = 3    # camel case                   
mybelovedvariable = 4    # lower letter
MYBELOVEDVARIABLE = 5    # capitalized
```

On Style

**Python operators**

Python has 35 reserved words that cannot be used as variable names. Here are some of the ones that will be useful for you. 
A full list can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics).
