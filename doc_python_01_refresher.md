### Common python IDEs
*Integrated Development Environments* (IDEs) are software that wraps all the tools needed for writing and testing 
 programs in a single toolkit. IDEs are more advanced than *code editors* (CEs), which are lightweight amd usually
only contain tools to write code (e.g., a text editor with syntax highlighting and simple bug catching). We reccomend
using an IDEs when writing, debugging and testing your code, as it will make your life way simpler.

Many online guides exist to choose IDEs (e.g., [this one](https://www.educative.io/blog/best-python-ides-ce-2021), or
