{: .no_toc }

For the scopes of this course, we assume you have basic knowledge of the python programming language. If you need a 
refresher, no problem, we have you covered! Just keep reading...

## Getting started
### Installing Python and quickstart
There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),<sup>*</sup> 
which will install Python alongside some useful packages. Make sure to use Python 3 (e.g., v.3.7 or superior). 

To check if Python was successfully  installed, you can use the following commands:\
On a Windows computer (command line):\
```C:\Users\Your Name>python --version```

On a Mac or Linux computer (terminal):\
```python --version```

Congrats! Now you have installed Python! You can find examples and exercises on how to get started with Python on the
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) website, in the 
[Python Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) page.

<sup>*</sup><u>Spoiler Alert!</u> Miniconda will be useful to install additional packages you might need, see the [Tools](doc_python_02_tools) page.

### Common python IDEs
*Integrated Development Environments* (IDEs) are software that wraps all the tools needed for writing and testing 
 programs in a single toolkit. IDEs are more advanced than *code editors* (CEs), which are lightweight amd usually
only contain tools to write code (e.g., a text editor with syntax highlighting and simple bug catching). We reccomend
using an IDEs when writing, debugging and testing your code, as it will make your life way simpler.

Many online guides exist to choose IDEs (e.g., [this one](https://www.educative.io/blog/best-python-ides-ce-2021), or 
[this other one](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide)). Here, you will just find a (non-extensive)
collection of our favourites:

**1. Visual Studio Code**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) is a full-featured code editor available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. 
It is small and light-weight, but full-featured, as well as open-source, extensible, and configurable for almost any task.
VS Code is full-featured despite having a small footprint.

**2. PyCharm**  

Itâ€™s the de facto Python IDE environment, with tons of support and a supportive community. It edits, runs, and debugs Python out of the box.

Cons: PyCharm can be slow to load, and the default settings may need tweaking for existing projects.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the de facto Python IDE environment, with a big community support. It is fully featured
and is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is available in both paid (Professional) and free (Community) editions, 
although the community edition might be somewhat limited for advanced tasks. Free educational licenses are available
for the Professional edition upon request.
