### Common python IDEs
*Integrated Development Environments* (IDEs) are software that wraps all the tools needed for writing and testing 
 programs in a single toolkit. IDEs are more advanced than *code editors* (CEs), which are lightweight amd usually
only contain tools to write code (e.g., a text editor with syntax highlighting and simple bug catching). We reccomend
using an IDEs when writing, debugging and testing your code, as it will make your life way simpler.

Many online guides exist to choose IDEs (e.g., [this one](https://www.educative.io/blog/best-python-ides-ce-2021), or 
[this other one](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide)). Here, you will just find a (non-extensive)
collection of our favourites:

**1. Visual Studio Code**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) is a full-featured code editor available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. 
It is small and light-weight, but full-featured, as well as open-source, extensible, and configurable for almost any task.
VS Code is full-featured despite having a small footprint.

**2. PyCharm**  
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the de facto Python IDE environment, with a big community support. It is fully featured
and is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is available in both paid (Professional) and free (Community) editions, 
although the community edition might be somewhat limited for advanced tasks. Free educational licenses are available
for the Professional edition upon request.
