## 8CC00 course
The 8CC00 course is designed for students with a basic understanding of Python programming who are interested in applying 
their skills to biomedical data analysis. The course will focus on improving students' ability to structure 
complex code and interpret data in a meaningful way. The course will cover advanced programming concepts such as 
object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, as well as data analysis techniques such as multivariate analysis, 
data visualization, and machine learning. The course will include hands-on programming exercises and projects that will 
challenge students to apply their skills in a biomedical context. Upon completion of this course, students will have 
developed the skills and confidence necessary to tackle complex programming and data analysis problems in a biomedical setting.

## What you will find here
This interactive webpage is aimed to be an additional (non-exhaustive) support to your learning and your voyage in the world
of data science! Here you will find code examples, explanations, and additional resources that might come in handy. 

## Learning objectives
1. Mastering Advanced Programming Concepts. One learning goal for students taking this course would be to develop a 
strong understanding of advanced programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. 
Students should aim to become proficient in writing complex code, structuring programs in a modular fashion, and implementing 
efficient algorithms to solve problems.

2. Developing Data Analysis Skills. Another learning goal for students will be to improve their data analysis skills. 
This includes developing a better understanding of multivariate analysis techniques, data visualization, and interpretation. 
Students should aim to become proficient in identifying trends and patterns in biomedical data, interpreting results, and 
presenting their findings in a clear and concise manner.

3. Applying Skills to Biomedical Problems. The ultimate goal for students taking this course should be to apply their 
programming and data analysis skills to solve real-world biomedical problems. This includes working on hands-on 
programming exercises and projects that challenge them to apply their skills in a biomedical context. Students 
should aim to develop the skills and confidence necessary to tackle complex programming and data analysis problems in a 
biomedical setting, and ultimately make a meaningful contribution to the field.
