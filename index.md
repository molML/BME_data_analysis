## The course
If you have a basic understanding of Python programming and are interested in applying 
your skills to biomedical data analysis, then you've come to the right place. 
The course will focus on improving your ability to :
1. Write and structure complex code.
2. Interpret complex biomedical data in a meaningful way. 
3. Have the right basis to further improve your coding and analysis skills.

Upon completion of this course, you should have developed the skills and confidence necessary to tackle complex programming 
and data analysis problems in a biomedical setting.

## How to use this website

This interactive webpage is aimed to be an additional (non-exhaustive) support to your learning and your voyage in the world
of data science! Here you will find code examples, explanations, and additional resources that might come in handy. 

The notebook is divided into four sections:
* [Getting started](doc_getting_started.md): here you will find all the necessary to approach advanced Python programming. Make sure you are up-to-speed with all these tools and their functioning before starting your adventure with the course!
* [Advanced programming](doc_programming.md): this section contains guiding principles to build advanced and reliable Python code. 
* [Object-oriented programming](doc_OOP.md): a primer on how to get started when using OOP principles in Python, and why it matters.
* [Data analysis](doc_data_analysis.md): here you will find key information on how to analyze complex and multivariate biomedical data.

Although these sections have been organized in a somewhat logical order, there's no right or wrong way to approach their content.
Thus feel free to skip, and go back and forth to whatever might need you. Below most pages, I've listed resources that might
help you learn faster/more effectively on specific topics of your choice. With the Search function üîé, you should be able to find what you need, faster.
Also, don't forget to check out our [Bonus](doc_bonus_tools.md) section!

## Thesis opportunities
Are you eager to apply data science, programming and machine learning to relevant problems in chemical biology and drug discovery?
Then, our group might be for you!
